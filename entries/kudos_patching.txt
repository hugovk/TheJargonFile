kudos patching

The practice of submitting patches to a project simply for the purpose
of gaming the participation statistics and being able to say:

"I have N patches in the well known and important project Foo".

Kudos patches are usually trivial re-alignments which could be done
automatically by any respectable text editor, changing the sequence
of variable declarations or function arguments and so on.
