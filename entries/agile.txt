agile

A piece of business babble used to describe a software development process
which hackers mostly did anyway, before the term existed. Hackers almost
never use the top down "divide and conquer" or "waterfall" method of
development and tend to just write, test, debug and then itterate with
occasional releases when things look stable enough.
