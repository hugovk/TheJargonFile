rockstar developer

Otherwise known as the 10x developer, the rockstar developer is part of a
mythology used as a labour intensification strategy by some unscrupulous
Sillicon Valley sweatshops. There's no actual evidence to support the
notion that some developers are innately and universally ten times better
than average. Instead, some have more knowledge and/or experience in
certain domains of computing and so can grind out code faster if they're
already fluent in a specialised domain. Put a "10x" developer onto a task
which they have no prior knowledge or experience of and they'll be not
much different from average.
