front door

Also known as "secure golden key". A political term refering to a
back door officially built into a cryptographic system in order
to give the government and its minions access to everything in
plain text for the purposes of mass surveillance. The word "front"
is used to signify that this is something officially approved and
which may be publicly known about rather than hidden.
