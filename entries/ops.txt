ops

Abbreviation of "operations". The activities carried out by a system
operator (sysop) or administrator (sysadmin). At some point after 2010
"systems administration" sometimes also became known as just "operations".

The term has also been used by various hacktivist groups in
situations where their activities include coordinated activity by
independent system operators.
